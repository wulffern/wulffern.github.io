title: Analog
---

I've been on a quest for the last 20 years to simplify how we make analog
circuits.

I can't say I've succeded yet, but that's not the point, it's an interesting
path to walk.

Along the way I've created some open source IPs.


## [aicex](/aicex)

Collection of IPs in Skywater 130 nm


## [dicex](https://github.com/wulffern/dicex)

A bunch of examples, SPICE, SystemVerilog, synthesis. I used
this when I tought Design of Integrated Circuits.
