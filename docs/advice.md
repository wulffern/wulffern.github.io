title: Advice
---

This is some advice, use it, or ignore it, who cares.

## Life
- Try to figure out what makes you happy, and do more of that
- If you don't know how to say sorry when you do something stupid, learn.
- When life sucks, run, or exercise, it's the only thing that works

## Computers
- Get a mac, time capsule,  time machine, and offsite backup. That ensures you'll never loose data.
- Learn Emacs, [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) is cool, but be sure to
  disable evil-mode.

## Programming
Find a problem that you really want to solve, and learn a programming language to solve it. There is absolutely no point in saying "I want to learn programming", then sitting
down with a book to read about programming, and expect that you will learn programming that way. It will not happen. The only way to learn programming is to program, a lot.

## Circuits
- Learn to check your assumptions. You will make mistakes, and you need to get good at finding the mistakes you made.
- Take your time to write a verification plan. And stick to it. Without sufficient simulation your circuit will not work.

# Stuff to ponder

Over a period of 10 months I was fortunate to spend some time at Electronics and
Computer Engineering Department, University of Toronto. I was there as a grad
student doing research on Comparator Based Switched Capacitor Circuits. Each
Wednesday we had a meeting with the other Ph.D. and Master students, which was
attended by Professor Ken Martin, Professor David Johns and Professor Trond
Ytterdal. The quotes and tips here should not be taken as facts, but rather as
``heads-up'' statements. Take these tips as something that should be checked and
thought about. I do not remember which quotes/tips came from which professor, or
indeed which student. So here goes


*This is important:** Do not worry about unknowns. Make a list of unknowns and find a test to check whether the unknown is a problem. Fixing things based on guesses will cause trouble.

## On Simulators

Use SMASH for simulation, it's the best SPICE simulator

SMASH is a simulator from Dolphin Integration. It's supposed to be on of the best SPICE simulators in the market. I have not personally tried it, mainly because the license is expensive compared to other simulators we have available.

## AC open, DC closed switch

In SPICE there is usually a switch or capacitor/inductor that has the behavior
of being open at AC and closed at DC or visa versa. Useful for setting common
mode voltages in simulation of differential operational transconductance
amplifiers.


## Measure capacitance

To measure capacitance on a node in a circuit simulation.

Bias the block
Put a small dc current into the node
Measure the delta V over a short time period
Calculate capacitance from i = C dv/dt
Always include a replica with a know capacitance value, i.e. a capacitor, to check your testbench.

## On Analog Design

Normally source jitter will dominate

This comment was made in reference to a 10-bit 50MHz ADC. So if you're designing
such a ADC you probably don't have to worry about jitter in the clock circuit.
However, you should be careful about your clock input. I know some people do
differential sinusoidal clocks and create a square wave clock on the inside of
the chip. Using differential signaling will help with possible interference from
nearby lines.


## Distortion from ESD protection circuits

When you go to high resolutions (> 10 bit) and high speed (>50MHz) the
non-linear capacitance of the ESD protection starts to matter. If you're doing
an ADC above this area you should read [Analysis and Measurement of Signal
Distortion due to ESD Protection Circuits](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1703690).


## Add net names in layout

Always add net names to layout nets, this will help LVS to match nets. It will also save you when tracking down shorts.

## Decouple to source node

In current mirrors, decouple to the source node. By decoupling between source
and for example vss, any high frequency jumps on vss will also appear on the
gate, thus the gate source voltage will stay constant and current will not
change


## Worry about current densities when routing > 20um

Metal wires on-chip have a maximum allowed dc current. This is due, among other
things, to electromigration. At high current densities the aluminum atoms may
migrate, and thus leave a void that might grow over time into to a
discontinuity. Why exactly >20um I don't know, but it was mentioned in a meeting
as a rule of thumb. Current densities are usually around 1mA/square, but varies
with technology


## Always shield signal lines above 10 bit level

If you're doing an ADC, or indeed any circuit, that requires > 10 bit accuracy
you should shield your signal lines. On chip you use metal below, above and
sides. The same for PCBs. Sensitive signals can be routed in in-between layers.


## Use a current source to feed inverter based oscillators

Check non-overlapping clocks in slow, high temp and low vdd

For non overlapping clocks you should check that the two clocks just meet in
slow corner, high temperature and low vdd. By meet I mean one clock should start
to rise when the other is almost at zero. Supposedly this PVT corner is the
worst for non-overlap, but I have not checked.


## Analog Sampling

If possible, you should sample analog just before digital IO switches. In other words, sample during quiet time.

## Cascode devices should be minimum size

You get less capacitance this way.

## The unit transistor W/L should be around 10-20

## Place noisy digital blocks in deep N-well

By separating substrates you improve noise immunity

## Shield analog blocks with deep N-well ring

Same thing as above

## Always route differential signals differentially

Mismatch between parasitic capacitances/resistors in differential signal routing
( differential means; two signals where one signal is phase shifted 180 degrees)
can introduce errors. The error is reduced if the parasitics are matched, since
the differential system cancels some of the errors.


## On-chip decoupling

Remember to check whether you need on-chip decoupling of references and power.
In most designs you do need decoupling, especially if you run at high speeds (>
10MHz).


## Variable delayed clock

If jitter is not important, and you want a variable delayed clock, you can use a
current starved inverter Place a current source inside or on the outside of your
inverter, and use a current mirror to control the maximum current.


## Cascode current mirrors

Current mirrors should be cascoded if possible. This is not possible in 90nm or
65nm technology unless you use wide swing cascode current mirrors.


## Normal current density for NMOS is in the range 5-15uA/square

## On Calibration & Test

Use serial shift registers for calibration bits

It is very common to include some off-line startup calibration circuits in ICs.
For example to tune transconductances, resistances, capacitances, offset
voltages etc. Usually this leads to some form of DAC that needs a digital input.
For these digital inputs a serial shift register should be used. Indeed for any
digital input that does not have to be synchronous, use serial shifting. The
best is to have a commercial bus like SPI or I2S, but this might be overkill.


Two registers should be used, one long shift register and one parallel load
register. First you shift in all you calibration bits, then you load them into
the parallel register. The calibration DACs are connected to the parallel
register. This is to avoid any funny stuff happening when you load your bits.
It's good to have control over the state of your circuit at all times. A long
shift register is not a problem, it does not cost much to add some more bits. In
a recent ADC I made, the shift register was 272 bits long.


The calibration register should have 4 inputs: data, data clock, reset, load.
The load signal is used to do the parallel load after shifting in all the bits.
You should also include a data output so you can check what was loaded in.


On all inputs you should use a Schmitt trigger to improve noise immunity.
Especially since the input data and clock may be feed from a computer with slow
rise and fall times.


## Design for test

Make sure that all on-chip DC voltages (bias points, power, references) are
available off-chip for measurement. Either through probe pads or analog test
multiplexers.


Use analog test multiplexer

Use an analog test multiplexer with T-switches to give you access to internal
nodes. A T-switch has two transmission gates and one NMOS. The first
transmission gate is placed close to the analog node you want to test, the
second close the test output. The NMOS is placed on the output side (not analog
node side) of the first transmission gate. When the T-switch is ON the two
transmission gates are closed and the NMOS is open. When the T-switch is OFF the
NMOS grounds the long line between the transmission gates, thus preventing
leakage between different test points of the analog multiplexer.


## Calibration currents

If you have a current source with off-line calibration, the calibration current
should be +- 50% versus nominal.


## Calibration DACs

For calibration DACs use 3 or 4 thermometer encoded bits and the LSBs binary
encoded.


## Access to gain boosters

If you're using gain boosters the boost voltage should be accessible off-chip.

## Default calibration state

The calibration DACs should start up in a default state close to the expected
state. Use inverters between the calibration register and calibration DACs to
set the default state.


## On ADC Measurement

### Crystal Oscillators

Crystal oscillators are used to generate a clean, low phase noise (low jitter),
clock signal. Two suppliers of such oscillators are Vectron International and
ECS INC International


### Careful circuit board design

If you move into the +10 bit accuracy range the circuit board (PCB) becomes
important. Especially if you're running at high frequencies. If you have
designed and produced an ADC, you want to test the ADC performance, not the PCB.
So you might want to exclude the circuit board as an error source. To do this
you can include a parallel ADC of same or higher resolution to test the PCB
performance.


I know of cases where a guy did a 12 bit ADC, made a circuit board, and tested.
The test showed very poor performance < 10 bit, and it turned out to be the
circuit board. Most of the extra noise was because he hadn't shielded his input
signal and taken care of routing of input signal. He spent in excess of 3 months
to track down the problem. And the solution was to redo the circuit board and
take better care of the input signal.


### Short circuit input on your ADC to measure noise floor

### Single ended to differential converter

In the range 0Hz - 2MHz you can use ADC driver, AD8138 Analog Devices For single
ended to differential conversion in the range > 2MHz a transformer should be
used.


### Non-harmonic spurs

When measuring your ADC, if you have spurs that are not harmonics in your FFT
you should try to change the clock frequency (sampling frequency) to see if the
spurs change frequency as well. If they do, they may be aliased interference from
nearby RF transmitters.
